# Hangman Game | Django

## Project Purpose

Creating this project to understand how Django framework works. I wanted to create something the user can interact with instead of a static website.

## How Does It Work ?

The user chooses one of the categories available and gets sent to a page. In this page user a random word will be turned into a hangman game question from the chosen category. With every wrong guess the images display a more progressed hangman. There is also a button above the image that can show the word and for if the user is struggling too much. 

## Word and Category Creation / Edit

Words and Categories can be created in their respective urls. They can be reached through the links on the navbar. All the words and categories will be presented for edits and deletions. 

## When You Lose / Win 

A random word is chosen again when the user wins or loses.
